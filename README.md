# Weed Detection Using InceptionV3
 
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model designed to detect weeds in images using the InceptionV3 architecture with a custom classification head. The model employs data augmentation, a dynamic learning rate scheduler, and various callbacks to ensure robust training and performance.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to classify images of weeds and crops, enabling automated agricultural solutions.
Key Features:

Pretrained InceptionV3: Utilized as the base model for transfer learning.
Data Augmentation: Applied aggressive augmentation to the training dataset.
Callbacks: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing for efficient training.
Evaluation: Validated the model using a separate dataset with moderate augmentation.

Usage
Training the Model
Organize your dataset as follows:

plaintext
Copy code
train/
    class_1/
    class_2/
valid/
    class_1/
    class_2/
Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Monitor training progress and logs to ensure the model is learning effectively.

Evaluation
Use the saved best_model.h5.keras to evaluate performance on a test set or unseen data:

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the saved model
model = load_model('best_model.h5.keras')

# Predict or evaluate
